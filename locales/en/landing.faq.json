    "landing.faq.general.a1": "Flyto2 is an automation tool that operates your computer like a human. Instead of writing code or learning complicated tools, you simply record your actions and Flyto2 learns to repeat them for you. It's designed to handle the tedious, repetitive tasks that steal your time - copying data, filling forms, moving files between apps - so you can focus on work that actually matters.",
    "landing.faq.general.a2": "No coding required! Flyto2 is designed for everyone, not just developers. If you can click and type, you can use Flyto2. Simply record yourself doing a task once, and Flyto2 learns to repeat it. There's no programming, no scripting, no technical setup - just show and go.",
    "landing.faq.general.a3": "Unlike other tools, Flyto2 lets you pause, verify, and resume at any step. You always stay in control - check what it's about to do, correct mistakes before they happen, and resume exactly where you left off.",
    "landing.faq.general.a4": "Absolutely. Flyto2 takes a safety-first approach. Your data is processed securely and never shared with third parties. We use encryption and strict access controls to keep your information protected at every step. We believe automation should help you, not expose you to risks.",

    "landing.faq.gettingStarted.a1": "Flyto2 works on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. It's designed to be lightweight, so even older machines can run it smoothly. For most tasks, you just need a regular computer - no special hardware required.",
    "landing.faq.gettingStarted.a2": "Just four simple steps: (1) Click \"Record\" to start capturing your actions, (2) Do the task you want to automate - click, type, copy, paste as you normally would, (3) Click \"Stop\" when you're done, (4) Give your recording a name and save it. That's it! Flyto2 learned what you did and can repeat it anytime.",
    "landing.faq.gettingStarted.a3": "Flyto2 works with websites, desktop applications, and file operations. It can interact with your browser, spreadsheets, documents, email, and most programs on your computer. If you can click it or type in it, Flyto2 can probably automate it.",
    "landing.faq.gettingStarted.a4": "Yes! You can schedule any recorded task to run at specific times - daily, weekly, or at custom intervals. Set it up once and let Flyto2 handle the rest. You can also trigger tasks based on events, like when a file appears in a folder.",
